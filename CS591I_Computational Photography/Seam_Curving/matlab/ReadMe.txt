In the main script, there are several sections that contain the codes used in this project:
0). Energy Function
	- two energy function are provided to choose from
	- energyfunc1: image gradient
	- energyfunc2: sobel operator
    - energyfunc3: entropy


1). Horizontal/Vertical Seam Carving
	- set the type = 'horizontal' or 'vertical' to indicate which direction of carving you plan to implement
	- set the number of seams you plan to remove

2). Image Enlarge
	- set the type = 'horizontal' or 'vertical' to indicate which direction of carving you plan to implement
	- set the number of seams you plan to insert 

3). Retargeting image with optimal seams-order
	- set the number of rows and column you plan to remove from the original image


4). Object Removal
	- running this section, you need to point out 4 points that build a rectangle with the target removal region inside
